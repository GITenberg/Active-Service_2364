description: How far would a father go to keep his daughter from marrying the wrong
  man? Rufus Coleman, the respected editor of the New York Eclipse, plans to marry
  Marjory Wainwright. Yet to her father, Professor Wainwright, Rufus is still the
  wastrel that he thought him to be as a student in college. To thwart the marriage
  the professor drags Marjory off with him and a group of students on a summer tour
  of Greece. Suddenly war erupts between Turkey and Greece! Will Rufus arrive in time
  to save the group? Will he redeem himself in the professor's eyes? Will the strife
  of war and trial of separation overcome the love between Rufus and Marjory?
